[h1] Vanilla+ QoL [/h1]

Vanilla Quality of Life mod intended to make the game more fun :)

[b]Features:[/b]
[list]
 [*] Add Calamity-style info for wings and hooks, showing you all kinds of useful information.
 [*] Town NPCs spawn at night and can move to their house at day.
 [*] The Team/PvP UI is fixed when Census or way too many Town NPC mods is installed so it doesn't overlap.
 [*] Remove the coloured Thorium tooltips, making the mod look more vanilla.
 [*] Remove the annoying "Enabled in Thorium mod configuration" crafting object message on sponsored items.
 [*] An option to use the metric system. Not enabled by default to not scare the yanks.
 [*] Display luck information when you have a Metal Detector or its upgrades. Icon courtesy of https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3013399263.
 [*] Shimmerable tooltip for item and NPC transformations.
 [*] Disable the exploit of moving Shimmer using pumps before Moon Lord is defeated.
 [*] Tooltip to show what ammo a weapon uses.
 [*] An option to automatically join a team in Multiplayer.
 [*] An option to share the map with your teammates in Multiplayer. (thank you Lan! https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2855922590)
 [*] Make the nurse heal players over time to stop exploits.
 [*] An option to remove Town Slimes, for those who hate them with a passion.
 [*] Shows permanent upgrades on the player/world selection screen.
 [*] A new chat tag to display NPCs in the chat! Usage: [npc:23] or [npc:ModName/NPCName].
 You can use the n or f options to hide the tooltip, or show the full body, like [npc/nf:18], which draws the full sprite of the Nurse with the tooltip disabled.
 [*] Ancient versions of 1.4.4 reworked melee items.
 [*] For those with skill-issues, lock on / auto-aim / aimbot for mouse and keyboard.
 [*] More buff slots! (configurable)

Everything is fully configurable.

Longer-term, this is meant to be a quality of life mod without cheating. Everything should require in-game effort (like a veinmining accessory) or have some drawback so the player doesn't skip half the game, like potion making.
If you are a modder, you can also enjoy the questionable quality "API"s I made to modify things which you shouldn't modify but hey, you can do it now!

If you have any suggestions, feel free to write them down, I'll consider them!
