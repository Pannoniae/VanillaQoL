Everything is fully configurable.

Longer-term, this is meant to be a quality of life mod without cheating. Everything should require in-game effort (like a veinmining accessory) or have some drawback so the player doesn't skip half the game, like potion making.
If you are a modder, you can also enjoy the questionable quality "API"s I made to modify things which you shouldn't modify but hey, you can do it now!
