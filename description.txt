Some day there will be a description, and a mod here :)

Right now, this mod adds Calamity-style info to hooks, showing you the reach and the number of hooks fired.

Longer-term, this is meant to be a quality of life mod without cheating. Everything should be requiring in-game effort (like a veinmining accessory) or have some drawback so the player doesn't skip half the game, like potion making.
