Vanilla Quality of Life mod intended to make the game more fun :)

Features:
 - Add Calamity-style info for wings and hooks, showing you all kinds of useful information.
 - Town NPCs spawn at night and can move to their house at day.
 - The Team/PvP UI is fixed when Census or way too many Town NPC mods is installed so it doesn't overlap.
 - Remove the coloured Thorium tooltips, making the mod look more vanilla.
 - Remove the annoying "Enabled in Thorium mod configuration" crafting object message on sponsored items.
 - An option to use the metric system. Not enabled by default to not scare the yanks.

Everything is fully configurable.

Longer-term, this is meant to be a quality of life mod without cheating. Everything should be requiring in-game effort (like a veinmining accessory) or have some drawback so the player doesn't skip half the game, like potion making.
If you are a modder, you can also enjoy the questionable quality "API"s I made to modify things which you shouldn't modify but hey, you can do it now!

If you have any suggestions, feel free to write them down, I'll consider them!
