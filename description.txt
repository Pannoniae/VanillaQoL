Vanilla Quality of Life mod intended to make the game more fun :)

Features:
 - Calamity-style info for hooks, showing you the reach and the number of hooks fired.
 - Town NPCs spawning at night and being able to move to their house at day.
 - Fixing the Team/PvP UI when Census is installed so it doesn't overlap.

Everything is fully configurable.

Longer-term, this is meant to be a quality of life mod without cheating. Everything should be requiring in-game effort (like a veinmining accessory) or have some drawback so the player doesn't skip half the game, like potion making.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to write them down!
