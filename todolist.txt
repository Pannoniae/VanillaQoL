- implement bigger/better lawnmowers:
- sold by golfer or crafted? idk
- could do 1x3 or 3x3 area
- biggest is 5x5
- maybe better lawnmower can mow other stuff as well?

- shitty pun of making some npcs traps in the no traps seed?
- disable pumps moving shimmer (it's a fucking cheat if you can't bucket it)
- add weebshit samurai npc? sells all the jap items in the game, says wise things, etc.
yes dynasty wood is chinese, shut up


cheaty qol, all of these should have a debuff if user enables it:
- NPCs sell potions, but player gets potion sickness if too many? maybe too exploitable
-
