- implement bigger/better lawnmowers:
- sold by golfer or crafted? idk
- could do 1x3 or 3x3 area
- biggest is 5x5
- maybe better lawnmower can mow other stuff as well?

- shitty pun of making some npcs traps in the no traps seed?
- add weebshit samurai npc? sells all the jap items in the game, says wise things, etc.
yes dynasty wood is chinese, shut up

"Full support. In fact, I'm going to suggest that an NPC's weapon be sold by the Pirate when he's living near that NPC.
It makes sense that the Pirate would steal (or make bootleg copies of) another NPC's weapon, and it would also add more content to the Pirate, who currently doesn't do much."
add weapon selling so you don't have to kill the poor NPCs

- place candles on floor
- taller trees WHEN YOU GROW THEM
- patch magic storage to take items out faster (right-click)
- main menu splash text
- only teleport town npcs to their houses when they are far away

- make truffle non-binary (teleport both by queen/king statue)
- pylons clean/prevent evil

- shop expander expands shops when you sell items so you'll have infinite space

- if player joins during bossfight, ENRAGE THAT BOSS TO 100% HEHEHEHEHEHE

- journey mode cheats in normal character/world?
- more journey mode cheats lol
- cal difficulty buttons on journey mode menu
- can't lower difficulty below 1.0x in normal mode worlds
- can't cheat in hardcore
- can't spawn items/medium cheats in mediumcore

- minishark rework. maybe add reloading? can steal the reload sounds from the shotgun
- could use more RoF and a bit more damage so it's not entirely useless

- enemies spread corruption/crimson/hallow with attacks

- remove adjacent to air requirement from removing walls (Player.CanPlayerSmashWall should always return true)#
- calamity reforge rework
- aether monolith can craft shimmer recipes
- keep position in world upon quitting
- "starter bag" for magic storage - add items to calamity bag / add "Hoarder" class to New Beginnings
- cat named Pannoniae? idk people have said so

 !!! we can ignore tml's stupid verify by slapping a ExtendsFromModAttribute on it with a nonexisting mod :))
 then we can derive from Mod again with a secondary class to return from TryGetMod/GetMod so strong references won't be fucked
 of course if you don't implement all of the spoofed mod this will still crash but eh
 alternatively, generate/emit the type at runtime where tml won't check it but I'd rather avoid it if we can just slap an attribute on it and be done

- ChatSource but have a tooltip instead of just slapping the modname on it

cheaty qol, all of these should have a debuff if user enables it:
- NPCs sell potions, but player gets potion sickness if too many? maybe too exploitable
-
