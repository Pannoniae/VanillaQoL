- display whip info (reach, count, pull velocity), Calamity feature
- remove "healer class/bard class" from thorium descriptions
- autoposition ui elements in conflicting mods maybe?

cheaty qol, all of these should have a debuff if user enables it:
- NPCs sell potions, but player gets potion sickness if too many? maybe too exploitable
-
