- implement bigger/better lawnmowers:
- sold by golfer or crafted? idk
- could do 1x3 or 3x3 area
- biggest is 5x5
- maybe better lawnmower can mow other stuff as well?

- shitty pun of making some npcs traps in the no traps seed?

cheaty qol, all of these should have a debuff if user enables it:
- NPCs sell potions, but player gets potion sickness if too many? maybe too exploitable
-
