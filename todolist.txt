- implement bigger/better lawnmowers:
- sold by golfer or crafted? idk
- could do 1x3 or 3x3 area
- biggest is 5x5
- maybe better lawnmower can mow other stuff as well?

- shitty pun of making some npcs traps in the no traps seed?
- add weebshit samurai npc? sells all the jap items in the game, says wise things, etc.
yes dynasty wood is chinese, shut up

- tent (like a bed but doesn't have to be in a room)
zapper's suggestions:
Change respawn timer when fighting bosses using an integer input (preferably with the capability of setting the timer to be more than 60 seconds, which the SRT mod wasn’t able to do)
Change the respawn timer when an event is happening (independent from boss respawn timer)
Custom timer for when no boss or event is present, if the timer duration is shorter than the player’s current timer (boss despawns for example) the timer is shortened to set duration. (Calamity does this already with a 3 second timer when there are no more bosses on screen but it would be cool to have if you didn’t want all of the content but quicker respawns.
Change the scaling of the timers for each difficulty.
Introduce scaling to the respawn timer based on the total amount of players in the world.
Introduce scaling to the respawn timer based on how many times you’ve died to the same boss (resets every time you start a new boss fight)
Players who respawn will automatically receive specified buffs/debuffs.
A new placable that acts like a bed spawn point but doesn’t need to be in a room.
Nurse healing gives a very strong healing buff which heals your missing HP over 10ish seconds (not a respawn mechanic but I’m not a fan of how op her healing is, regardless of potion sickness (especially in multiplayer)).

"Full support. In fact, I'm going to suggest that an NPC's weapon be sold by the Pirate when he's living near that NPC.
It makes sense that the Pirate would steal (or make bootleg copies of) another NPC's weapon, and it would also add more content to the Pirate, who currently doesn't do much."
add weapon selling so you don't have to kill the poor NPCs

- place candles on floor
- taller trees WHEN YOU GROW THEM
- patch magic storage to take items out faster (right-click)
- main menu splash text
- ninja NPC when King Slime is defeated
- shop expander but better, no buttons inside the fucking shop
(also hijack mod.calls and trick tmodloader into thinking the actual shopexpander is loaded, so mod compat works)

- make truffle non-binary (teleport both by queen/king statue)

- mod incompat screen

- mass-sell items into NPC shops

- tombstones merge into one item when picked up -> when you place one down a random one gets placed
- jungle rose/nature's gift glows in jungle

 !!! we can ignore tml's stupid verify by slapping a ExtendsFromModAttribute on it with a nonexisting mod :))
 then we can derive from Mod again with a secondary class to return from TryGetMod/GetMod so strong references won't be fucked
 of course if you don't implement all of the spoofed mod this will still crash but eh
 alternatively, generate/emit the type at runtime where tml won't check it but I'd rather avoid it if we can just slap an attribute on it and be done

- ChatSource but have a tooltip instead of just slapping the modname on it

cheaty qol, all of these should have a debuff if user enables it:
- NPCs sell potions, but player gets potion sickness if too many? maybe too exploitable
-
