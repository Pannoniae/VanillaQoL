ImprovedRespawning=Improved Respawning uses a patch from Vanilla+ QoL without implementing it correctly, so the game will crash.
ShopExpander=Vanilla+ QoL expands NPC shops with pages as well. Disable one of the mods, otherwise you might encounter errors.
ShopExtender=Vanilla+ QoL expands NPC shops with pages as well. Disable one of the mods, otherwise you might encounter errors.
NoBreakingDoors=Vanilla+ QoL incorporates the patch in No Breaking Doors and fixes it. You don't need No Breaking Doors, it will crash.
NoNPCHappinessReborn=Vanilla+ QoL is not compatible with Happiness Removal Reborn because it patches the same code. You can use Vanilla+ QoL's happiness disable feature instead.
